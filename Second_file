So this is second file to this second repository. I still don't know how to delete a branch but i saw the option for it 
when i merged branch-out to main branch.
We will repeat this process again. And create another branch out and then merge it with the main branch.
Great!!! Sound good.
Okay so we have created branch-out2 and now we are in this branch to make changes to the second file we added to the repository. 
Okay, these are enough changes.
